    <section class="c1"> This repository contains the source code of the practical use case described in the book Learn Microservices with Spring Boot (2nd Edition).

        The book follows a pragmatic approach to building a Microservice Architecture. You start with a small monolith and examine the pros and cons that come with a move to microservices.
        
        Chapter 3 version
        In Chapter 3, the goal is to build a Spring Boot application according to good practices:
        
        Domain-Driven Design. We analyze the boundaries of the Users and Challenges domains.
        3-layer Application Design. This chapter focuses on two of the layers: Controller, and Service.
        Test-Driven Development. You write tests before building the functionalities.
        Monolith First. We keep two domains separate by using different root packages.
        The next figure shows the status of the Multiplication application by the end of the Chapter, as it's also included in this repository.
